# ECG_CompressiveSampling
The file contains, slides, codes, and a manuscript around compressive Sampling of ECG signal for telemonitoring application.
DFT and Total Variation transforms are used as the sparsifying bases .. 
Different Random and deterministic measurement matrices are evaluated .. 
Some basic and structured sparse recovery algorithms are compared .. 
All codes are original, except of some reconstruction algorithms refered in the manuscript.
