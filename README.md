# ECG_CompressiveSampling
The file contains, slides, codes, and a manuscript around compressive Sampling of ECG signal for telemonitoring application.
DFT and Total Variation transforms are used as the sparsifying bases .. 
Different Random and practical deterministic measurements based on m-sequence codes are evaluated .. 
Some basic and structured sparse recovery algorithms are compared .. 
All codes are original, except of some reconstruction algorithms refered in the manuscript.
